# Glue42 Workspaces in React

This is a template for creating a React Workspaces application for [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) or [**Glue42 Core**](https://glue42.com/core/).

The Workspaces App is a web application (also called Frame) which comes with **Glue42 Enterprise**. This application is the shell that can hold multiple [Workspaces](https://docs.glue42.com/glue42-concepts/windows/workspaces/overview/index.html#workspaces_concepts-workspace) as tabs in a single or multiple windows (Frames). The Frame application is a vital element in the Workspaces functionality as it handles opening and closing Workspaces, arranging windows in a Workspace, adding or removing Workspaces and windows.

## Prerequisites

For a **Glue42 Enterprise** project, you need to have [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) 3.11 or newer.

For a **Glue42 Core** project, you need to have [**Glue42 Core**](https://glue42.com/core/) V2.

## Usage

- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
- Run `npm run start` to start the app.

Depending on your project, follow the instructions for creating a custom Workspaces App in the [**Glue42 Enterprise** Workspaces documentation](https://docs.glue42.com/glue42-concepts/windows/workspaces/overview/index.html#extending_workspaces) or the [**Glue42 Core** Workspaces documentation](https://core-docs.glue42.com/capabilities/windows/workspaces/workspaces-app/index.html).
